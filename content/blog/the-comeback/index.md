Over the last couple of years I haven't made a concerted effort to blog, and in general this website has been fairly unmaintained. My last post was in July 2021 which was over a year and a half ago, and most of my contributions to this website have been merging dependency updates. I did however author one blog post in the past year on [Brex's Engineering Blog](https://medium.com/brexeng) which you can check it out if you like: [Backstage Adoption at Brex](https://medium.com/brexeng/backstage-adoption-at-brex-b415e0e7d3a6)

That being said, this blog post is meant to spark the comeback of my personal blog! This blog itself will not be a long or well thought out post but will function as a warmup for things to come. I've found in the past that the best methods to get into the writing mood are to constantly write down blog ideas when they come, and then to sit down and get my thoughts out. So while I have been keeping track of potential ideas, I haven’t spent the time to just sit and write. So I’ve decided to start small with this blog post. One word of wisdom I can give in this post for others who want to start a blog or get back into blogging: write something, anything and post it. The audience may be small or even just yourself, but it can be the spark you need to kickstart your blogging.
