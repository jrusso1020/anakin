description: My initial blog setup and learnings from creating this website
---

Hi I'm James Russo and this is my first attempt at a blog, so bear with me on this. I'll try not to repeat too much of what you can find in my [About Me](/about) section. This blog has been something I've wanted to do for a few years now, but obviously it was somethign I never devoted enough time to. I thought it would be a idea to help me learn some new things while also hopefully helping other people who may run into similar problems.
