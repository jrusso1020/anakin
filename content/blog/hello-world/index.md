Hi I'm James Russo and this is my first attempt at a blog, so bear with me on this. I am well aware of my level of writing, so I apologize in advance if any of my posts are hard to read or understand. I'll try not to repeat too much of what is already in my [About Me](/about) section, so head over there if you want to find out more about me.

This blog has been something I've wanted to do for a few years now, but obviously it was something I never devoted enough time to or got around to. I thought it would be a good way to help me try some new technologies and build my web development skills. My main goal of this blog is to detail projects or features I implement, problems I encounter during development, and my solutions to them. I hope by doing this that I am able to help someone else out and save them some time. Every once in a while I might talk about another topic as well or discuss something I find interesting.

This blog is an MVP. I know it’s not perfect and I know it can use a lot of work. I’m hoping to incrementally add features and improve this site, because I like an iterative development process. Over the years I’ve thought of a few different technologies to implement this blog in. I’ve looked at building it in Flask, Ruby on Rails, React, Elixir, or some combination of those technologies. However, I’ve decided to go with Gatsby for the time being. Gatsby is a static site generator that allows you to develop using React. I use React extensively at work so I thought it would allow me to implement this fairly easy. Gatsby was introduced to me by my CTO at [Rockets of Awesome](https://rocketsofawesome.com), Josh Stewart, and I’ve had a fairly good time using it.  I started with the [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) which was created by one of Gatsby’s creators Kyle Matthews. I’ve made some changes and added some dependencies, but I thought it was fairly straightforward to get started with. The blog setup and development will be discussed in a future post though.

Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy reading this blog. My goal is to help at least one other developer with the work I post here. So if you find anything helpful feel free to reach out and let me know!
